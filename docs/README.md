# Introduction

wikipedia.js is a lightweight [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) module that allows you to easily interact with the [Wikipedia REST API](https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/#/).

Getting data from the world's largest online encyclopedia shouldn't be difficult, and wikipedia.js aims to uphold that philosophy.
